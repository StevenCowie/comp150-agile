What are the key challeneges game developers encounter when applying agile in a remote context whilst using SCRUM

The question I am looking for an answer for to is what are the key challeneges game developers encounter when applying agile in a remote context whilst using SCRUM . I intend to address it by looking at papers which focus on when the team is split up in different locations to see what problems can arise but also look at the benfits of not being together and by reading game developer blogs which talk about this topic to see their thoughts on it.
